# 🏡 California Housing Prices – Regression Project

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using machine learning techniques. It includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **regression modeling** to build a reliable predictive model.

## 📦 Project Features

- Load and clean real-world housing data
- Visualize correlations and geospatial patterns
- Apply and evaluate regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Use pipelines and cross-validation for robust evaluation

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** California Housing dataset from [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html)
- **Features:** Median income, housing age, rooms, population, etc.
- **Target:** Median house value in a block group

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
